<font color="#0000CC">Cassie:</font color="#0000CC"> So, Gracie, tell us all about this new guy.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Well, he isn't actually a new guy yet. We haven't met.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara: </font color="#0000CC">Online dating?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, exactly.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie: </font color="#0000CC">Great, when are you meeting up then?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Tomorrow, at the Smugglers bar.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara:</font color="#0000CC"> Not very posh<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC"> It was his choice<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie: </font color="#0000CC">It's not that bad<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara:</font color="#0000CC"> So what's he like? You have to tell us all about him.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC"> We have only sent messages so far<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara: </font color="#0000CC">What's his name?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Jimmy.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie:</font color="#0000CC"> Do you have a pic of him<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, Here on my phone<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara: </font color="#0000CC">Ooooh lets see.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC"> Just a minute let me find it.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara:</font color="#0000CC"> Have you sent him one of you?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, sent it yesterday.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie: </font color="#0000CC">I am sure he will be impressed.<p>
 <font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC">I hope so<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara: </font color="#0000CC">I am sure he will.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC"> Ahh here it is.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie: </font color="#0000CC">Wow! He's gorgeous.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara: </font color="#0000CC">Yes! He is. Lucky girl<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie:</font color="#0000CC"> He looks very young though.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara: </font color="#0000CC">How old is he?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Ok, a bit younger than me I think<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara:</font color="#0000CC"> Actually he looks quite a bit younger.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC"> I know, but I think it will be alright.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie:</font color="#0000CC"> Maybe he is the kind of guy that likes older women.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC"> (Indignant) I am not an older woman. <p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie: </font color="#0000CC">Well you are older than him<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Not by much<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara:</font color="#0000CC"> You are 42 Grace, he looks like early twenties<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Not unusual these days. Is it?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie: </font color="#0000CC">Hmmm. Maybe not.<p>
<font color="#0000CC"> Sara: </font color="#0000CC">If he is ok with it, I guess it is not a problem.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie: </font color="#0000CC">Has he seen a picture of you Grace?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, of course - The one you took of me when we visited Cambridge<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie: </font color="#0000CC">GRACE!!!! That was eighteen years ago.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, but it is a nice picture of me<p>
 <font color="#0000CC">Sara:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh Grace, you should have sent a more recent one<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie:</font color="#0000CC"> Have you told him your age?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">He hasn't asked.<p>

<font color="#0000CC">Kevin:</font color="#0000CC"> Here's the drinks lads. Lager for you Jimmy and Guinness for you Neil.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil:</font color="#0000CC"> Ahh thanks Kev<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Cheers<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">Not very busy here tonight.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">It never is on Tuesday<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin:</font color="#0000CC"> It's Wednesday Neil<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">Well, not very busy on Wednesdays either.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Actually, I hope it is quiet on Thursdays as well<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">Why?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">I've got a date tomorrow and we are meeting here<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">Here? You could have taken her somewhere nicer than The Smugglers.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Aww it's not too bad here.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">It's ok for a game of darts or pool but hardly the place to impress a lady<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">We can always go on to somewhere else.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">Where did you meet her then?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Well, we haven't actually met yet. One of those online dating thingy's â€“ you know what I mean<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">I didn't even realise you knew how to use a computer<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil:</font color="#0000CC"> He's still working out how to use a pocket calculator<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Ha ha, very funny<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin:</font color="#0000CC"> In fact I didn't think you even owned a computer.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">I don't<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil:</font color="#0000CC"> How did you manage to make a date online then? I can't imagine you doing it with your phone<p>
<font color="#0000CC"> Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">I got my nephew to do it. He's pretty good at all that technical stuff. And any replies I get he messages to me on my phone<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">So what is she like then. <p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> She is very nice actually, And we seem to have a lot in common.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin:</font color="#0000CC"> Like what?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Well you know I love fishing? It seems she does too<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil:</font color="#0000CC"> That's a good start then.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> And motorbikes<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin:</font color="#0000CC"> That's handy then as you don't have a car.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> And she is lovely looking<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">You've seen a pic of her then?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">Yes My nephew sent it to me yesterday<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">Let's have a look at it<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Just a minute let me find it<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">This could take a while<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> No it won't<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">It had better not take too long, it's your round next<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Here it is, her name is Grace.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">lets see<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin:</font color="#0000CC"> Wow Jimmy, she is lovely looking<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Yeh. That's what I thought<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">She looks great Jimmy but....... Errr. I don't want to be rude mate but she looks a bit young for you<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">Doesn't matter much these days does it<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">Well it does to some people she only looks about twenty<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">She might be very mature for her age<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">She looks half your age Jimmy that might be a bit of a gap.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">No. It would be alright. Actors and pop stars do it all the time, Go out with younger girls.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin:</font color="#0000CC"> That is very true Jimmy but you are not an actor or pop star, you are a plumber. A bit of a subtle difference there.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">Harrison Ford used to be an electrician<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">That was when he was eighteen. He is older than you now.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">A lot older actually<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">She obviously doesn't mind that you are older though if she has arranged to meet you<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin:</font color="#0000CC"> You have told her you are 43 haven't you Jimmy?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">Well, no. She didn't ask<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">Oh dear!<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">So she has no idea?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">She'll get a bit of an idea â€“ I was going to send her a picture<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">Oh that's a good idea<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin:</font color="#0000CC"> ( a little suspiciously) Which picture were you going to send Jimmy?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">That one you took of me on my motorbike.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">What!!! Jimmy, in that pic you are wearing a crash helmet with a dark visor over your face<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">Yeh, true. So I abandoned that idea and sent a different one<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">A different one?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes. My nephew sent one of himself instead<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">Are you quite mad Jimmy? When she turns up to meet you she is expecting someone that looks like your nephew<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">Well, there is a family likeness<p>


<font color="#818589S">Scene three A beachside bar in an English seaside town</font color="#818589S"><p>

<font color="#0000CC">Cassie: </font color="#0000CC">Do you think you ought to message him Grace? Let him know that it is not a recent picture?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC"> (A big sigh) I suppose I should but I don't want to spoil the date.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara: </font color="#0000CC">It will be spoilt anyway if he is looking around the pub for somebody that existed nearly 20 years ago<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">It's not all about age. We have similar interests<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie: </font color="#0000CC">Really? Like what?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">All sorts of things<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara:</font color="#0000CC"> Tells us one then.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">He likes fishing<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie: </font color="#0000CC">Fishing?? How is that a similar interest? The closest you have got to fishing is picking up a tin of tuna from a supermarket shelf.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">He can teach me about it.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara: </font color="#0000CC">I don't want to seem mean Gracie but I really don't think you have handled this very well<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Gracie: </font color="#0000CC">It's alright for you two. You both have nice husbands. I get really lonely sometimes<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie:</font color="#0000CC"> Hey sweetie, we are not trying to be mean but if you want to meet someone it is best to start off on the right foot. Be more honest with him.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes I know you are right really. Maybe I should call the whole thing off.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Sara: </font color="#0000CC">or you could message him, explain about the picture and see if he still wants to meet.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Cassie: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, that would be the best idea.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC"> Ok then. I'll do that.<p>

<font color="#818589S">Scene four: The Smugglers Pub.</font color="#818589S"><p>

<font color="#0000CC">Neil:</font color="#0000CC"> Jimmy, a family likeness is nothing like a picture of the person she is expecting to meet.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin:</font color="#0000CC"> Neil is right Jimmy, it's really not a very fair thing to do. You should come clean mate.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Come clean?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes. Get your nephew to message her and explain she was sent a pic of him by mistake<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Hmm, she is going to think I am an idiot<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin:</font color="#0000CC"> Maybe<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">Shut up Kev. We have to help Jimmy out with this<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Maybe it would be easier to just call the whole thing off.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">That's an option but  you never know, once you have explained everything she may still want to meet up<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">Kev's right Jimmy. You have nothing to lose by explaining it was a mistake. At least when you meet up then you both know what's what.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> I suppose you are right. I'll send a message to Grant, my nephew, get him to sort it out.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kev:</font color="#0000CC"> Good idea Jimmy. Start off on the right foot<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh just a minute â€“ he has just messaged me<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">What does he say?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> He has had a message from Grace. It seems she made a mistake too<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">How?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">Apparently she sent a picture that was taken 18 years ago<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">So you are about the same age then?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">I guess so<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kevin: </font color="#0000CC">It could work out much better Jimmy. <p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">And she also said she has never been fishing in her life but happy to give it a try.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Neil: </font color="#0000CC">Can't be fairer than that.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> She does like tuna though.<p>

<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Excuse me, I just noticed you sitting there on your own. Would you happen to be Grace?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Yes I am. You must be Jimmy?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes I am. Hello, pleased to meet you.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Pleased to meet you too Jimmy<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Can I get you a drink:<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Love one please<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> What would you like?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC"> Gin and tonic please.<p>

<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">Thanks luv<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> Two years to the day since we first met in this pub<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC"> (laughing) Yes it was and we both almost messed it up and never met at all.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> We had to come back and celebrate didn't we.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">I will always hold this pub in great affection. So glad we did actually meet Jimmy. It was a near miss.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy: </font color="#0000CC">I guess fate took over<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC"> And look what has happened. I now love fishing<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> And now I have a motorbike â€“ and a car<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace: </font color="#0000CC">It was the happiest day of my life when you asked me to marry you.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Jimmy:</font color="#0000CC"> It was the happiest day of my life when you said yes (There is a sound of a kiss)<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Grace:</font color="#0000CC"> Love you Jimmy<p>
